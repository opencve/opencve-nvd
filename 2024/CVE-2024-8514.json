      "value": "The Prisna GWT â€“ Google Website Translator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.11 via deserialization of untrusted input from the 'prisna_import' parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code."
