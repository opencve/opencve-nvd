This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Sony XAV-AX5500 devices. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of WMV/ASF files. A crafted Extended Content Description Object in a WMV media file can trigger an overflow of a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the device.\n\n. Was ZDI-CAN-22994."
