The admin panel is subject to potential Cross-site scripting (XSS) attach in case an admin assigns a valuator to a proposal, or does any other action that generates an admin activity log where one of the resources has an XSS crafted. This issue has been addressed in release version 0.27.7, 0.28.2, and newer. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may redirect the pages /admin and /admin/logs to other admin pages to prevent this access (i.e. `/admin/organization/edit`)."
