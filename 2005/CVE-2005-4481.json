      "comment": "1. The XSS flaw described was only part of the custom implementation of the http://www.polopoly.com/ site. It was never part of any version of any Polopoly product, nor delivered to any of Polopolyâ€™s customers.\n2. The XSS flaw that existed (the search form in the upper right corner) on the www.polopoly.com site has been fixed.\n3. When www.polopoly.com had the XSS flaw it was based on Polopoly 8.6. Polopoly 9.x was never involved what so ever in this issue. And as I said earlier, the flaw was not part of Polopoly 8.6 either, it was only in custom implementation code of the www.polopoly.com site.\n4. The www.polopoly.com site is not personalized nor permission controlled, so there was no information of any value to steal by exploiting the XSS flaw.",
